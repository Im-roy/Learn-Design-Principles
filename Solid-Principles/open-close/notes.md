# Open close Principle

Open-Closed Principle, states that a class/object should be open to 
extension but close for modification. What does that mean practically? 
> It means that if it is necessary to change a specific class because of new business requirements, it is better to create a new code for the changes or new functionality instead of affecting the existing one in the cases where it is possible.
