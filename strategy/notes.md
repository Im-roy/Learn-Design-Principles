# Strategy design pattern

The strategy design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms,
encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. 
This allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it. The strategy pattern 
allows for a group of related algorithms to be replaced with one of the algorithms at run-time. 
It can be used to provide a flexible and extensible solution for a variety of related problems.
